Starting this fall, My will join the Precision Medicine Pathway at Washington University. The overall goal of the Precision Medicine Pathway is to prepare students to be at the forefront of meeting the challenges in defining and implementing precision medicine.  The Pathway will introduce students to the use of genomic and genetic information in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, from covering current concepts and practice to identifying gaps that remain to be filled.  The Pathway will (a) expand students' educational experience into the clinical realm; (b) facilitate making clinical connections related to thesis research, where relevant; (c) provide career path information, from introducing potential areas for postdoctoral research to alternatives to the traditional Principle Investigator track.
