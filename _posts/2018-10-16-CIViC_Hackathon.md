A [hackathon and curation jamboree](https://civicdb.org/meetings) was held as a pre-meeting of ASHG, led by the CIViC project team, in collaboration with the ClinGen Somatic working group, and hosted by the Scripps Research Institute. The focus of this meeting was to continue to develop community consensus on data standards for interpretation of variants in cancer, engage software developers for improved variant interpretation software, engage clinical experts for curation of content and enhance integration and interoperability of resources. Additional related topics were proposed by meeting participants. Topics were tracked in the [civic-meeting GitHub repo](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic-meeting/issues). The meeting was supported by the National Cancer Institute, International Society for Biocuration, and Washington University.
