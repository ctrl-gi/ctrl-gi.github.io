Alex Wagner was awarded [an NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award](https://crtc.wustl.edu/programs/junior-faculty/k12oncology/) through the National Human Genome Research Institute to support his research in [normalizing and interpreting the clinical actionability of genomic variants](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=9744231&icde=0). The K99/R00 Pathway to Independence is designed to facilitate a timely transition of outstanding postdoctoral researchers with a research and/or clinical doctorate degree from mentored, postdoctoral research positions to independent, tenure-track or equivalent faculty positions. This program provides independent NIH research support during the transition to help awardees launch competitive, independent research careers.
