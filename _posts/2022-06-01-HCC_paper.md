Highlights

- Non-cirrhotic HCC genomically resembles cirrhotic HCC
- Comprehensive genome- and transcriptome-wide profiling allows detection of novel structural variants, fusions, and undiagnosed viral infections
- NR1H4 fusions may represent a novel mechanism for tumorigenesis in HCC
- Non-cirrhotic HCC is characterized by genotoxic mutational signatures and dysregulated liver metabolism
- Clinical history and comprehensive omic profiling incompletely explain underlying etiologies for non-cirrhotic HCC highlighting the need for further research
