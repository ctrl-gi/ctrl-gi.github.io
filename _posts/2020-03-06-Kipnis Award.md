Erica Barnell (MD/PhD 2022) was recently selected as the winner of the David M. Kipnis Award in Biomedical Sciences. This award, which was established in honor of Dr. Kipnis, former Chair of the Department of Medicine and an advocate for basic research, is designed to identify (annually) M.D./Ph.D. (or Ph.D.) students in the Division "whose thesis work has led to new insights about the molecular basis of various human diseases." This award was based on the research that Erica conducted as a PhD candidate in the Griffith lab. Specifically, her research included the development of bioinformatic tools that advance our understanding and utility of precision oncology.
