Precision oncology relies on accurate discovery and interpretation of genomic variants, enabling individualized diagnosis, prognosis and therapy selection. Dr. Alex Wagner led a study, published today in [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0603-8), which found that six prominent somatic cancer variant knowledgebases were highly disparate in content, structure, and supporting primary literature, impeding consensus when evaluating variants and their relevance in a clinical setting. 

Dr. Wagner and colleagues developed a framework for harmonizing variant interpretations to produce a meta-knowledgebase of 12,856 aggregate interpretations. This work demonstrated large gains in overlap between resources across variants, diseases and drugs as a result of this harmonization. They subsequently demonstrated improved matching between a patient cohort and harmonized interpretations of potential clinical significance, observing an increase from an average of 33% per individual knowledgebase to 57% in aggregate. Their analyses illuminate the need for open, interoperable sharing of variant interpretation data. In addition, they provide a freely available web interface ([search.cancervariants.org](https://search.cancervariants.org)) for exploring the harmonized interpretations from these six knowledgebases.
