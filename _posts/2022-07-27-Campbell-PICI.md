Katie Campbell, a Griffith lab alumna and current UCLA postdoctoral fellow,was named a [Parker Bridge Fellow by PICI](https://www.parkerici.org/person/katie-campbell-phd/), in partnership with the V Foundation. Bridge Fellows are senior postdoctoral investigators working to answer the most critical questions in cancer immunotherapy as they transition into faculty positions from mentorship with PICI Network leaders.

Campbell studies cancer genomics and immunotherapies in melanoma in the laboratory of physician-scientist Antoni Ribas, MD, PhD, a professor of medicine, surgery and molecular and medical pharmacology and director of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Center at UCLA. She is working to better understand the factors that determine which patients' tumors will respond to immunotherapy and which won't.
