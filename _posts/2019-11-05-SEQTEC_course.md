Obi Griffith and Malachi Griffith, along with Griffith lab members, Kelsy Cotto, Felicia Gomez, and Huiming Xia, recently attended and taught at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory's [Advanced Sequencing Technologies and Applications course](https://meetings.cshl.edu/courses.aspx?course=C-SEQTEC&year=19). The five of them covered topics related to RNA sequencing, including QC, alignment, expression, and differential expression. Information regarding these topics can be found on [rnabio.org](rnabio.org), which the lab keeps up to date with its latest materials taught.
