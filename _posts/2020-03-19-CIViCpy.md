CIViCpy ([civicpy.org](http://civicpy.org)), a Software Development Kit (SDK) and analysis toolkit, enables high-throughput queries on variant interpretation data from the CIViC knowledgebase. Led by co-first authors Alex Wagner and Susanna Kiwala, CIViCpy has already been utilized by the CIViC team for use in the [civic2clinvar](https://github.com/griffithlab/civic2clinvar) utility and for VCF exports of CIViC content. The associated manuscript was [published online today](https://ascopubs.org/doi/pdf/10.1200/CCI.19.00127) in a special issue on _Informatics Tools for Cancer Research and Care_ in JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics. This CIViCpy publication highlights the evaluation of >1,200 variants per second using the built-in pre-cache and search routines on the real-world AACR Project GENIE dataset. CIViCpy is [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/griffithlab/civicpy) and permissively (MIT) licensed.
