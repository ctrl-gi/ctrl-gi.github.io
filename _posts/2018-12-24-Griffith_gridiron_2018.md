The 2018 fantasy football season has ended, and Malachi Griffith has led the _Thundering Typhoons_ to become
the lab champions until the close of next season. The toilet bowl trophy goes to our last-place 
team, _No Tengo Idea_, managed by Kilannin Krysiak. An honorary mention goes to rookie manager Thomas Mooney, who led
the _Evansville Crimson Giants_ to second place in our traditional lab competition.
